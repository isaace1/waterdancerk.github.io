DETAILS: I really like this short loop out to Wye. Its not partciulrly challenging, but its a nice, quick run. For some reason, I often seem to accidentally time doing this route with running events. Today it was the virtual marathon runners who were doing strerling work onn what was, frankly a grotty day. On the way to Wye, I pick up cycle route XX which takes you through the back of Kennington past the Julie Rose and then down Blackwall Lane. This is a great route out of Ashford and also our favourite route for riding to Canterbury. 
Once we get to Wye, its over the railway bridge and over the A28 before heading past Eastwell Manor and onto Sandyhurst Lane. I usually cut across into Godinton at this point, taking the road past the park which leads you towards Great Chart and a quick ride past Singleton Lake.
